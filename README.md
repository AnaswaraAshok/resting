Give it a chance

## Mission
The mission of Resting is to simplify daily work of developer in testing and analyzing HTTP/Rest requests.

Resting takes inspiration from Postman with the goal to be light and focused on the management of saved requests.

## Principles
Project tries to follow these principles:
* KISS and YAGNI trying to maintain project light in code and libraries
* Keep the focus on result: the development cycle is composed by two steps: the first takes deliberately technological debt to ship features in a quick way, the second applies a phase of refactor to maintain the code clean.

The project follows the semantic versioning
